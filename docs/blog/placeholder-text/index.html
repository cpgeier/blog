<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>I really like looking at data and I thought watching the first 2019 Democratic debates were pretty exciting. I wanted to see if it was possible for me to create a live stream of Tweets from twitter around the election. I thought it would be really cool, especially during debates, to see what people were tweeting about.</p>

<h2 id="twitter-api">Twitter API</h2>

<p><img src="https://cpgeier.github.io/blog/img/twitter_streaming_api.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Twitter API has a streaming API endpoint and I used this to get all the data that I use in the application. The <a href="https://github.com/bear/python-twitter">python-twitter</a> python package was super useful for connecting to the api.</p>

<p>To pipe data in constantly I deployed a Python script with Docker on Azure Container service. This is the only part of the tech stack that may cost money, however this part could be run from a Raspberry Pi. I used the Azure Student discount in this case so it didn&rsquo;t cost anything for me.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-store-twitter-data">Where to store Twitter data?</h2>

<p>Elasticsearch is a great place to put Twitter data because the data can be easily searched or filtered. I was able to have my Elasticsearch server hosted for free through <a href="https://bonsai.io/">https://bonsai.io/</a>. Although they use an older version it works pretty well.</p>

<p>To use the free Elasticsearch service I had to impliment a way to clear out old records in the server since I only have ~120mb on the free server version. I ended up just instructing my Python function to clear old records after the size gets over 100mb.</p>

<h2 id="an-api-for-elasticsearch-data">An API for Elasticsearch data</h2>

<p>Now I needed a way to retrieve that data from Elasticsearch. Express is a fantastic backend and while I was searching for real-time data stream platforms I found <a href="Socket.io">Socket.io</a> which seemed to have a really good support and documentation.</p>

<p>I ended up following <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/real-time-charts-using-angular-d3-and-socket-io/">this tutorial</a> to get up and running with Angular, D3, and Socket.IO.</p>

<h2 id="front-end">Front end</h2>

<p>For the front end I used Angular, Bootstrap and Ngx-Charts. Originally I used the D3 setup from the tutorial, but I figured D3 was too combersome to plot simple streaming data.</p>

<h3 id="streaming-tweets">Streaming Tweets</h3>

<p>One of the major problems I ran into was trying to get the Twitter tweets to render and then disappear in a way that looked good.</p>

<p>The reason why two tweets appear now isn&rsquo;t really intentional. Originally I wanted to have one tweet on the screen that instantly switches to a new tweet after a period.</p>

<p>However since the only easy way to render tweets in the Twitter way is to use their Javascript which doesn&rsquo;t play nice with Angular.</p>

<p>I ended up doing a really weird hack to get it to work and if I spend more time on this project I&rsquo;ll probably try to fix it.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">      <span style="color:#75715e">// @ts-ignore
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>      <span style="color:#a6e22e">twttr</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">widgets</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">createTweet</span>(
        <span style="color:#66d9ef">this</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">tweetId</span>,
        document.<span style="color:#a6e22e">getElementById</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;tw-&#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">this</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">first</span>)
      );
</code></pre></div>

<p>The key was using this javascript to embed the tweet in the page rather than chaning the embed HTML.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>All the tools I used are listed here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Elasticsearch

<ul>
<li>Tweet storage</li>
<li>Ability to filter tweets</li>
<li>Deployed through Bonsai.io</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Express &amp; Socket.io

<ul>
<li>Maintains live connection to send data</li>
<li>Calls Elasticsearch every second for new data</li>
<li>Deployed through Azure Container Service</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Angular &amp; Bootstrap

<ul>
<li>Front end framework</li>
<li>Deployed through Heroku</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Someother tools I used were:</p>

<ul>
<li>DockerHub - Free container builds</li>
<li>Freenom - Free domain hosting</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving forward</h2>

<p>The way I host my application (Heroku, Netlify, and Azure Container Service) allows me to have CD of the application as I make changes to it. I hope to containerize more of my services to make this project easier to host.</p>

<p>Also, in the future I&rsquo;m hoping to add more live visualizations of specifically tweet keyword data like &ldquo;Joe Biden&rdquo; or &ldquo;Donald Trump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of my main objectives with this site is to stay as unbiased as possible and so I&rsquo;m hoping to add visualizations that go cater to all sides of the election.</p>
